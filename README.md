Put any images files you want in `%LOCALAPPDATA%Low\Volcanoid\Volcanoids\ModConfigs\Decal-Loader`

They will load and be usable in game. They all appear in the "Modded" category.

It will remember ids and handle custom decals in saved games, but there's a slight issue.
A single game load (Of anything. Just press new game.) is required to load the decals before you load a game with those decals in it. This must be done *once* per game launch.

If you don't, the game loads before the decals are ready.
